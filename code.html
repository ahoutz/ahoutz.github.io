									<p>I grew up in Great Falls, Montana. 60,000 people call Great Falls home - a massive city by Montana standards. As a child, I enjoyed typical American things - I played baseball, lit fireworks, rode bikes. But I was also a 6th generation Montanan. I spent a lot of time outdoors and loved to hike. I grew up with the common-sense practicality ingrained in so many Montanans. But my family is also composed of curious, intellectually-minded people. </p>
									<p>Naturally, therefore, I was drawn to both a practical and intellectual field: economics. I took an economics class in high school and was hooked. I decided to stay in the mountains and went to Montana State University for my undergraduate degree in economics. I loved my classes, but became interested in law as well. After finishing my undergraduate degree in three years, I decided to try law school. I quickly discovered that I missed the mathematical rigor and modeling in economics. I took a year off, studied for the GRE and applied to PhD programs.</p>
									<p>The University of Notre Dame accepted me. Its location in a rural area (at least compared to the other schools I was accepted into) appealed to me. Originally wanting to go into applied micro, I found in my first macro class that I was meant to be a macroeconomist. Since then, I have devoted myself to studying New Keynesian models. My third year paper was on NGDP targeting analysis in the New Keynesian framework. As I enter the dissertation stage of my PhD, I am learning heterogeneous agents model, the fiscal theory of the price level, and the sequence-space Jacobian toolbox in Python.</p>
									<p>At Notre Dame, I have taught a number of classes associated with the first year PhD sequence. I taught math camp in the summer of 2022 and am slated to do so in the summer of 2023. I also taught the recitation section for Econometrics I and the recitation section for Econometrics II. Currently, I am a research assistant for Cynthia Wu and Benjamin Pugsley.

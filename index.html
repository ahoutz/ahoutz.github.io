			You can find my job market paper, ``How Government Debt Shocks Impact the Economy'', <a href="/pdfs/Houtz_JMP.pdf#toolbar=0" target="_blank">here</a><br>
			Abstract: I identify exogenous government debt shocks using high-frequency movements in U.S. Treasury futures prices around auction announcements. In a VAR,
				these shocks raise interest rates across the yield curve, including the federal funds rate, while prices increase, output falls, unemployment rises, and
				the monetary base shrinks. I interpret these findings as evidence of fiscal dominance and show that a standard monetary-dominant model cannot replicate
				the empirical impulse responses. In an estimated business cycle model, I find that debt shocks offset part of the disinflation of the 1980s, contributed
				to growth in the 1990s, and slowed the recovery from the Great Recession.

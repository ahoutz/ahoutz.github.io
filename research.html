		<p><i>Job Market Paper</i></p>
		<p>	<b>Abstract:</b> I identify exogenous government debt shocks using high-frequency movements in U.S. Treasury futures prices around auction
			announcements. In a VAR, these shocks raise interest rates across the yield curve, including the federal funds rate, while prices
			increase, output falls, unemployment rises, and the monetary base shrinks. I interpret these findings as evidence of fiscal dominance
			and show that a standard monetary-dominant model cannot replicate the empirical impulse responses. In an estimated business cycle
			model, I find that debt shocks offset part of the disinflation of the 1980s, contributed to growth in the 1990s, and slowed the
			recovery from the Great Recession.

		  <h4 id="content">The Uneven Welfare Costs of the Volcker Disinflation</h4>
		  <p> with Benjamin Pugsley and Hannah Rubinton <br> Revise and Resubmit at <i>JPE: Macro</i><br> </p>
		  
		  
		  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong>
		  
		    We use a Heterogeneous Agent New Keynesian (HANK) model to quantify the distribution of welfare gains and losses of the US
			Volcker disinflation. In the long run households prefer low inflation, but the Volker disinflation requires a transition period
			characterized by a sharp increase in the real interest rate and unemployment, as well as a redistribution from net nominal
			borrowers to net nominal savers.  %Welfare costs may be significant for households with nominal liabilities. 
			We calibrate the model to match the micro and macro moments of the early 1980s high-inflation environment and 
			examine the actual changes in the nominal interest rate and inflation over the Volcker disinflation. While aggregate
			welfare gains are positive, the effects are highly skewed across households; just over 50 percent would prefer to avoid
			the disinflation. This share depends negatively on the liquidity value of money, positively on the average duration of nominal
			borrowing, and positively on the short-run increase in the real interest rate and unemployment.

		    <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>
		    <p>
		      I embed a nominal GDP level target in a Taylor-type rule and compare the volatilities of output,
		      inflation, and the nominal rate to a standard, inflation-target Taylor rule. I demonstrate analytically that the source
		      of the shock matters for relative variances. With an NGDP level target, a productivity shock results in more stable output
		      but more volatile inflation. Cost push shocks and demand shocks result in more stable output and inflation. These results are,
		      with small caveats, confirmed in an estimated quantitative model. Last, I impose a zero lower bound (ZLB) and simulate the model
		      under both targets. An NGDP level target hits the ZLB less often than an inflation target at the cost of longer sessions at the
		      ZLB. Switching to an NGDP level target while at the ZLB leads to quicker economic recovery through the Fed's use of forward
		      guidance.

									<p> My research focuses on monetary and fiscal policy, with an emphasis on the intersection
									    between the two. My job market paper focuses on how government debt influences monetary
									    policy and the consequences of that behavior. My second chapter studies NGDP targeting analytically
									    and quantitatively. My third chapter addresses the fiscal theory debate empirically and constructs
									    a model that dynamically incorporates active monetary policy and active fiscal policy. 
									    Throughout these projects, I have developed a working knowledge of heterogeneous agent models
									    and their solution methods as well as Bayesian estimation methods
									    for dynamic models.

									<p> <b>Abstract:</b> I examine the impact government debt has on monetary policy. Using VAR
										analysis, I demonstrate that debt forecasts a long-run decrease in the nominal
										rate. This finding yields a new perspective on monetary policy in the long-run. I
										build a DSGE model that implements the dynamics found in the VAR and analyze
										equilibrium responses to fiscal shocks. After estimating the model, counterfactual
										analysis shows that peak inflation following the COVID-19 recession would have
										been X% lower had the Fed not responded to the growth in government debt.

									<h4 id="content"><i>Taming Volatility: Evaluating NGDP Targeting</i> (preparing for submission)</h4>
									<p> <b>Abstract:</b> This study compares the impact of NGDP and inflation targeting on macroeconomic variability
										and welfare outcomes using analysis on the canonical New Keynesian model and a quantitative DSGE model.
										Results demonstrate that under NGDP targeting, real variables exhibit greater stability in response to shocks
										at the cost of increased inflation volatility. NGDP targeting reduces the role of monetary policy under
										productivity and cost-push shocks. In the long run, welfare results are virtually equivalent between NGDP
										and inflation targeting.

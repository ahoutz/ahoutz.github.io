		<p> I specialize in analyzing monetary and fiscal policy through quantitative modeling, counterfactual analysis,
		    numerical methods, and time series econometrics. My work focuses on understanding the implications
		    of policy changes, identifying and analyzing debt shocks, leveraging high-frequency data for empirical analysis,
		    and modeling using heterogeneous agents.

		<h4 id="content"><i>Government Debt: Cost-Push Shocks and Fiscal Theories</i> (in progress)</h4>
		<p> I examine the impact of US government debt financing shocks on United State business cycles.
		    I first identify financing shocks empirically using Treasury auction data.
		    Resulting VAR impulse responses strongly resemble a cost-push shock, with the exception of falling
		    federal funds rates. I then replicate the VAR responses in a state-of-the-art heterogeneous agent model. 
		    An increase in government financing costs tightens the ability of firms to borrow, lowering output and
		    increasing inflation. Permissive monetary policy prevents explosive debt dynamics at the cost of higher
		    inflation.

		<h4 id="content"><i>Taming Volatility: Evaluating NGDP Targeting</i> (preparing for submission)</h4>
		<p> <b>Abstract:</b> I embed a nominal GDP level target inside a Taylor-type rule and compare the volatilities of output,
			inflation, and the nominal rate to a standard, inflation targeting Taylor rule. I demonstrate analytically that
			the source of the shock matters. NGDP level targeting delivers more stable output and more volatile inflation
			under productivity shocks, but more stable output and inflation under supply and demand shocks.
			These results are generally confirmed in an estimated quantitative model. Lastly, I impose a zero lower bound
			(ZLB) and simulate the model under both targets. NGDP level targeting hits the ZLB more often than inflation 
			targeting. Switching to an NGDP level target while at the ZLB leads to quicker economic recovery, but leaves
			monetary policy constrained longer.

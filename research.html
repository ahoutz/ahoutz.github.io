		<p> I am a macroeconomist specializing in analyzing monetary and fiscal policy, with a research portfolio
		    that showcases my expertise in quantitative modeling, counterfactual analysis, numerical methods, 
		    and time series econometrics. In my first paper, I explore the economic consequences of the Federal
		    Reserve adopting a nominal GDP target over an inflation target. I utilize quantitative modeling,
		    demonstrating my ability to analyze complex monetary policies thoroughly. 
		    My second paper leverages time series econometrics to identify US government debt
		    demand shocks and adopts state-of-the-art modeling software to provide theoretical explanations. 
		    Currently, I am in the exploratory stages of my third paper, where I seek to employ intraday 
		    Treasury futures data to identify debt supply shocks, further honing my skills in high-frequency data
		    analysis and empirical VAR techniques. These projects equipped me with a comprehensive skill set essential 
		    for rigorous economic research and policy analysis. Presenting my work sharpened my ability to communicate 
		    complex ideas clearly, and reporting my findings strengthened my writing skills.

		<h4 id="content"><i>Taming Volatility: Evaluating NGDP Targeting</i> (preparing for submission)</h4>
		<p> <b>Abstract:</b> I embed a nominal GDP level target inside a Taylor-type rule and compare the volatilities of output,
			inflation, and the nominal rate to a standard, inflation targeting Taylor rule. I demonstrate analytically that
			the source of the shock matters. NGDP level targeting delivers more stable output and more volatile inflation
			under productivity shocks, but more stable output and inflation under supply and demand shocks.
			These results are generally confirmed in an estimated quantitative model. Lastly, I impose a zero lower bound
			(ZLB) and simulate the model under both targets. NGDP level targeting hits the ZLB more often than inflation 
			targeting. Switching to an NGDP level target while at the ZLB leads to quicker economic recovery, but leaves
			monetary policy constrained longer.
